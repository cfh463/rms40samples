    # At this point, our database is in exactly the same state as it was before we started.
    # It's as if the "Delete" SQL statement had never existed
    
    # Now let's execute a different statement that we actually want
    # Begin another transaction...
    Rho::Database.startTransaction()
    
    # Execute updates - we can issue multiple SQL commands within the same transaction
