                   Several properties affect the appearance of the signature capture functionality. You can set their values before showing the capture interface:
               </DESC>
               <CODE lang=’ruby’>
           <![CDATA[ 
	# Change fullscreen from true (default) to false           
    Rho::Signature.fullScreen = false;
    # Change background color from white (default) to black
    Rho::Signature.bgColor = "#000000"
    # Change pen color from blue (default) to white
    Rho::Signature.penColor = "#FFFFFF"  
                   ]]>

               <DESC>
                   this is another section that is part of the same example, use multi sections when want to separate code blocks with descriptions for each
               </DESC>
               <CODE>
           <![CDATA[
This is the second code block of the same example
                   ]]>
